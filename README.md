# Frame Flicks Backend - Node + Express (Converted Scaffold)

This project is an autogenerated scaffold that mirrors  project structure
It includes:
- Express app entry (`app.js`)
- Sequelize DB config (`src/config/db.js`)
- Models converted from schemas (minimal placeholders)
- Controllers and Routers for each detected module (CRUD placeholders)

## Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill DB credentials.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run in dev: `npm run dev` (requires nodemon) or `npm start`
4. The server will run on `PORT` from `.env` (defaults to 3000).

Notes:
- Models are minimal placeholders. Replace fields and add relations according to your original schemas.
- Replace `db.sync()` with migrations in production.
- I can continue by converting each controller precisely mapping logic from your Python controllers if you want full parity.# OTT
