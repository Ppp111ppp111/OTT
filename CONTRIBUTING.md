# Contributing to Frame Flicks Backend

We're excited that you want to contribute to this project! To keep things organized and ensure code quality, we follow a few simple guidelines.

## The Golden Rule

**All changes must be made through Pull Requests.** Direct pushes to the `main` branch are disabled to protect the codebase.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the Repository**
    Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page on GitHub. This creates a copy of the project in your own GitHub account.

2.  **Clone Your Fork**
    Clone the repository from your account to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/frame-flicks-backend-node-full.git
    cd frame-flicks-backend-node-full
    ```

3.  **Create a New Branch**
    Create a descriptive branch for your new feature or bug fix.
    ```bash
    # For a new feature:
    git checkout -b feature/add-new-movie-endpoint
    
    # For a bug fix:
    git checkout -b fix/user-login-bug
    ```

4.  **Make Your Changes**
    Write your code, add your tests, and make sure everything works as expected.

5.  **Commit and Push Your Changes**
    Add your changes, write a clear commit message, and push the branch to your fork.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add new movie endpoint"
    git push origin feature/add-new-movie-endpoint
    ```

6.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
    - Go to the original repository on GitHub.
    - You should see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your recently pushed branch. Click it.
    - Add a title and a description of the changes you made, then create the pull request.

One of the project maintainers will review your PR, provide feedback, and merge it once it's ready. Thank you for your contribution!
